Cigarette is my life said many.A cigarette, or cigaret, is a small cylinder of finely cut tobacco
 leaves rolled in thin paper for smoking. The cigarette is ignited at one end causing the cigarette
 to smoulder and allowing smoke to be inhaled from the other end, which is held in or to the mouth; in some cases, a cigarette
 holder may be used, as well. Most modern manufactured cigarettes are filtered, and also include
 reconstituted tobacco and other additives.The term cigarette, as commonly used, refers to a tobacco

  A cigarette is distinguished from a cigar by its smaller size, use of processed leaf, and paper
wrapping, which is normally white, though other colors and flavors are also available. Cigars are
typically composed entirely of whole-leaf tobacco.
Rates of cigarette smoking vary widely throughout the world and have changed considerably since
cigarettes were first widely used in the mid-19th century. While rates of smoking have over time
leveled off or declined in the developed world, they continue to rise in developing nations.
